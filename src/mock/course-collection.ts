    description:
      "The behind-the-scenes functionality of a website is referred to as the 'back-end'. It is a combination of technology and programming that powers a website, consisting of three parts that a user never sees: a server, an application, and a database. The back-end runs a website â€” the user does not see it or interact with it, but it is always running in the background, delivering functionality and a desktop-like experience. Back-end developers play a critical role in web development teams, and make sure that data or services requested by the front-end system or software are delivered.",
